########

Made with Tkinter, pandas, numpy, pillow, csv and lxml.

Some of the libraries probably arent needed but this
is my first real program outside of something simple
and math based.

Gui starts up and you have 3 selections:
Add
Delete
Search.

All 3 failrly self explanatory.

Adding creates a new line in an excel sheet based on
the skills entered.

Deleting deletes the entire row of someone that matches
the search term(Everyone i work with has unique login
names which cancels out the need to check between
two people with the same name)

Searching uses pandas to build a data frame and return
it on screen as a new label.

I spent many an hour writing this so I hope it isnt
too hectic code wise.

Enjoy!
